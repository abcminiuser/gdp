GDP - The Generic Device Programmer
===================================

What is it?
---------------------

GDP is aimed to be an eventual alternative programmer front-end similar to the
ATPROGRAM tool from Atmel, but cross-platform, open-source and supporting third
party tools. It aims to lower the barrier to entry to adding new device, tool
protocol and transport support, with a consistent front-end interface.


What about AVRDUDE?
---------------------

AVRDude, an alternative project similar to GDP and ATPROGRAM is already
available and widely used. However, it is written in C which discourages some
people from contributing, and uses its own internal device and tool
configuration files. GDP aims at supporting multiple device back-ends, including
the raw device XML files pulled from Atmel Studio.


Project Status
---------------------

It's a new project, so don't expect functional *anything* right now. Fork, poke,
pull-request if you're interested, otherwise just sit back and wait for a public
beta release.


Support
---------------------

The project support is listed below.


Device Definitions:

+ Atmel AVR Studio Device XML


Tools:

+ Atmel AVR8 DFU Bootloader
+ STK500
+ STK600
+ AVRISP
+ AVRISP-MKII
+ JTAG-ICE MKII


Protocols:

+ Atmel DFUV1 Protocol
+ Atmel STKV2 Protocol (ISP, HVSP, HVPP, PDI, TPI and XMEGA JTAG interfaces only)
+ Atmel JTAGV2 Protocol (Stub only, no implementation)


Transports:

+ Atmel Jungo USB Transport
+ Atmel AVR8 DFU Transport
+ Serial Transport


Input File Formats:

+ Intel HEX (HEX, EEP)
+ Binary (BIN)
+ Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)


User Interfaces:

+ CLI (PROGRAM, VERIFY, CHIPERASE and ERASE commands)


Prerequisites
---------------------

The following is required to use GDP currently in its original Python form:

+ Python 2.7
+ PyUSB Library
+ PySerial Library
+ PyELFTools Library
+ IntelHex Library

If compiled with the PyInstaller toolkit, the above is not required as all
dependencies are converted into a native platform executable.

In addition, the device files from Atmel Studio are required for the current
device backend.
