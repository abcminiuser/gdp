Convenience Scripts
-------------------
When IntelHex is installed and added to the system path, 
some scripts are available for usage. 
Each one is meant to be operated from the command line. 
They provide help if called incorrectly.

``intelhex`` package

Embedding into other projects
*****************************
IntelHex should be easy to embed in other projects. 
The directory ``intelhex`` containing ``__init__.py`` can be directly placed 
in a depending project and used directly. From that project the same import 
statements described above can be used to make the library work. 
From other projects the import statement would change to::

    >>> from myproject.intelhex import IntelHex

Alternatively, the IntelHex package can be installed into the site-packages 
directory and used as a system package.

In either case, IntelHex is distributed with a BSD-style license. 
This permits you to use it in any way you see fit, provided that the package 
is appropriately credited.
